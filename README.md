## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to build an accurate and efficient email spam detection model using machine learning and NLP techniques. By training on a dataset of emails labeled as spam or non-spam, the model can classify new emails, helping reduce spam in email inboxes.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains labeled emails with a binary classification: `spam` or `non-spam`. Key features extracted from the emails include word frequencies, text length, and other linguistic features that can help distinguish spam from legitimate emails.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- pandas
- numpy

You can install the required packages using:
